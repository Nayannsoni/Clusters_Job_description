Their focus lies in the</p><p>iteration area of implementation versus setting the strategy or defining the key</p><p>deliverables. A product owner’s focus stays with the specific solution, underlying and</p><p>supporting technologies, and the implementation team(s) they’re working with.</p><p> Program Increment (PI) Planning –</p><p>o PO is heavily involved in program backlog refinement and preparation for PI</p><p>planning and plays a significant role in the planning event.</p><p>o PO updates the team backlog and typically reviews and contributes to the program</p><p>vision, Roadmap, and content presentations</p><p>o PO is involved in story definition, providing the clarifications necessary to assist the</p><p>team with their story estimates and sequencing.</p><p>o The entire Agile team, which includes the PO, also work together to determine their</p><p>team PI objectives for the upcoming PI.</p><p> Iteration Execution</p><p>o Maintaining the team backlog – With input from System Architect/Engineering and</p><p>other stakeholders, the PO has the primary responsibility for building, editing, and</p><p>maintaining the team backlog. Consisting mostly of user stories, it also includes</p><p>defects and enablers.</p><p>o Iteration Planning – The PO reviews and reprioritizes the backlog as part of the</p><p>preparation work for Iteration Planning, including coordination of dependencies with</p><p>other PO. During the iteration planning event, the PO communicates story detail and</p><p>priorities and ensures the team aligns and agrees on a final iteration plan.</p><p>o Apply Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) – POs collaborate with their team to</p><p>detail stories with acceptance criteria and examples in the form of acceptance tests</p><p>o Accepting stories – The PO works with the team to agree on accepted story</p><p>completion. This includes validating that the story meets acceptance criteria, that it</p><p>has the appropriate, persistent acceptance tests, and that it otherwise complies with</p><p>its Definition of Done (DoD). In so doing, the PO also assures a level of quality,</p><p>focusing primarily on fitness for use</p><p>o Understand enabler work - While POs are not expected to drive technological</p><p>decisions, they are supposed to understand the scope of the upcoming enabler work</p><p>and collaborate with System and Solution Architects/Engineering to assist with</p><p>decision-making and sequencing of the critical technological infrastructures that will</p><p>host the new business functionality</p><p>o Participate in team demo and retrospective – collaborate with their team and any</p><p>other stakeholders in the team demo. They also participate in the Iteration</p><p>Retrospective, where the teams gather to improve their processes and are active in</p><p>the Agile Release Train’s (ART’s) Inspect and Adapt (I&amp;A) workshop</p><p> Program Execution:</p><p>o During each PI, the PO coordinates dependencies with other POs. The PO also has</p><p>an instrumental role in producing the System Demo for program and Value Stream</p><p>stakeholders.</p><p> Inspect and Adapt:</p><p>o PO works across teams to define and implement improvement stories that will</p><p>increase the velocity and quality of the program.</p><p>o PO has an instrumental role in producing the PI system demo for program</p><p>stakeholders.</p><p>An Ideal Candidate Should have</p><p> Ideal candidates should have a minimum of around 7+ years of Experience with at least</p><p>3 years of Product Owner Experience.</p><p> You should have prior experience of providing leadership in Digital Transformation,</p><p>Responsible for Defining the Strategy, Solutions and RoadMap for new technology</p><p>incubation in your experience.</p><p> You should have Collaborated (or) Spearheaded multi-year tech deals with budgets over</p><p>$5M - $50 and revenue growth in your previous experience.</p><p> You should have led strong Customer Relationships , Technology Practice Development</p><p>and Service Delivery, Digital IP &amp; solutions development, pre-sales.</p><p> Should have Hands on experience on Building or Leveraging of SAAS platforms bridging</p><p>the gap between technology &amp;business processes to solve business problems using</p><p>Solution- Driven architectures.</p><p> Should have managed a hierarchy and a team of at least 15+Member Engineering team.</p><p> Should be strong in Program Managing large technology Projects.</p><p> Tech Skills Required: Building SAAS Platforms, SAFe POPM Certification is a nice to</p><p>have capability</p><p> Education: B Tech + MBA or equivalent degree will be preferred</p></body></html>",Bengaluru
